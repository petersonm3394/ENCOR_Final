## ⚠️ WARNING: IP SLA SCRIPT CAN DISRUPT THE NETWORK

This repository contains an **IP SLA automation script that is intentionally disruptive by design**.

If executed incorrectly, this IP SLA script may:
- Force unintended routing changes
- Trigger failover events unexpectedly
- Cause traffic to oscillate between paths
- Disrupt active network sessions
- Break upstream or downstream connectivity
- Create instability due to aggressive tracking or timers

Because IP SLA directly influences routing decisions, **misconfiguration or improper execution can lead to widespread network impact**.

---

## ❗ Intended Use of the IP SLA Script

The IP SLA script is intended **only** for:
- Controlled lab environments
- Failure simulation and testing
- Demonstrating the impact of dynamic path tracking
- Validating redundancy and recovery behavior

It must **never** be run on:
- Production networks
- Shared environments without approval
- Networks without console access or rollback plans

---

## 🔒 Safety Requirements Before Running IP SLA

Before executing the IP SLA script:

- ✅ You fully understand the IP SLA operation and tracking logic
- ✅ You understand how routing decisions depend on IP SLA results
- ✅ You have console access or a verified local fallback user
- ✅ Routing configurations are backed up
- ✅ You are prepared to manually recover from a failure

If these conditions are not met, **DO NOT RUN THE IP SLA SCRIPT**.

## 🧠 Final Note on IP SLA

IP SLA is a powerful tool that directly affects network stability.

> **When combined with automation, IP SLA can rapidly amplify configuration mistakes.**

Use with caution.
